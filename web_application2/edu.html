            <h2>Understanding HIV/AIDS</h2>
            <p>HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is a virus that attacks the immune system, and if untreated, can lead to AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome). HIV is transmitted through bodily fluids, primarily during unprotected sex, blood transfusions, or sharing needles.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>How HIV is Transmitted</h2>
            <p>HIV can be transmitted through specific bodily fluids, including blood, semen, vaginal fluids, and breast milk. It is important to take preventive measures to reduce the risk of transmission, such as using protection during sex and avoiding the sharing of needles.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Prevention Methods</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Safe Sex Practices:</strong> Using condoms and engaging in safe sex practices reduces transmission risk.</li>
                <li><strong>PrEP (Pre-exposure Prophylaxis):</strong> Medication that, when taken consistently, significantly reduces the risk of getting HIV.</li>
                <li><strong>PEP (Post-exposure Prophylaxis):</strong> A medication taken after potential exposure to HIV to prevent infection.</li>
                <li><strong>Regular Testing:</strong> Knowing your status helps prevent unknowingly spreading the virus.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Importance of Testing</h2>
            <p>Regular HIV testing is critical for early detection and prevention. Many people who have HIV are unaware of their status, so testing is important for knowing your health and protecting others.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Treatment Options</h2>
            <p>HIV treatment has advanced significantly, and antiretroviral therapy (ART) allows individuals with HIV to live long, healthy lives. ART is a daily medication regimen that reduces the virus in the blood to undetectable levels.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Support and Resources</h2>
            <p>Getting support from friends, family, or support groups can help individuals with HIV lead fulfilling lives. Reach out to local health organizations or counseling services for additional support.</p>
