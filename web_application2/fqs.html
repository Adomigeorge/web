        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions on HIV/AIDS</h1>

        <section>
            <h2>1. What is HIV, and how does it differ from AIDS?</h2>
            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is a virus that attacks the body's immune system. If untreated, HIV can lead to AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome), which is the final stage of HIV infection where the immune system is severely weakened. Not everyone with HIV develops AIDS, especially with proper treatment.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>2. How is HIV transmitted?</h2>
            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> HIV is transmitted through contact with certain bodily fluids from an infected person, such as blood, semen, vaginal fluids, rectal fluids, and breast milk. It is most commonly spread through unprotected sex, sharing needles, or from mother to child during childbirth or breastfeeding.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>3. Can HIV be prevented?</h2>
            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes, HIV can be prevented. Safe practices include using condoms during sex, taking pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) if at high risk, never sharing needles, and ensuring that blood products are tested for HIV. Pregnant women living with HIV can also receive treatment to prevent transmission to their baby.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>4. What are the symptoms of HIV?</h2>
            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> HIV symptoms vary by stage. Early-stage symptoms can resemble flu symptoms, such as fever, sore throat, and fatigue. As HIV progresses, symptoms may include swollen lymph nodes, weight loss, fever, and night sweats. Many people do not show symptoms until HIV has significantly weakened their immune system.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>5. How is HIV diagnosed?</h2>
            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> HIV is diagnosed through a blood or saliva test that detects HIV antibodies, antigens, or the virus itself. Regular testing is recommended for those at high risk. Testing facilities and home test kits are available for convenience and confidentiality.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>6. Is there a cure for HIV?</h2>
            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Currently, there is no cure for HIV. However, antiretroviral therapy (ART) can effectively control the virus, allowing individuals to live long, healthy lives and reduce the risk of transmission to others. Ongoing research is focused on finding a cure.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>7. What is ART, and how does it work?</h2>
            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> ART (antiretroviral therapy) is a combination of medications that prevent HIV from replicating, which helps maintain a low viral load and protects the immune system. Taking ART daily as prescribed can reduce the virus to undetectable levels, making it untransmittable to others.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>8. Can I have a healthy relationship if Iâ€™m HIV-positive?</h2>
            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes, people living with HIV can have healthy, fulfilling relationships. Open communication, practicing safe sex, and adherence to ART can minimize the risk of transmission to partners. Support from partners and disclosure discussions can also strengthen relationships.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>9. How does HIV affect pregnancy and childbirth?</h2>
            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> With proper treatment, people living with HIV can have healthy pregnancies and reduce the risk of transmitting HIV to their child. ART during pregnancy, delivery, and breastfeeding lowers the transmission risk to below 1%.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>10. What is PrEP, and who should consider it?</h2>
            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis) is a daily medication that reduces the risk of HIV infection in HIV-negative individuals at high risk, such as those with an HIV-positive partner or people who inject drugs. PrEP is highly effective when taken consistently.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>11. How can I support someone living with HIV?</h2>
            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Offer empathy, respect, and understanding. Encourage adherence to treatment and support their healthcare decisions. Educating yourself on HIV can help reduce stigma, and supporting them emotionally can make a significant positive impact.</p>
